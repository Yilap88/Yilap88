## About Me

I am a Petroleum Engineer with a Master's degree in Applied Economics and solid experience in data analysis for the commercialization and transportation of oil and natural gas. Throughout my career, I have developed data-driven solutions to optimize processes and improve decision-making in the energy sector.

Recently, I have deepened my expertise in **Data Science** and **Machine Learning**, focusing on predictive modeling, advanced analytics, and data-driven business strategies. I am passionate about applying **machine learning algorithms**, **statistical models**, and **big data techniques** to generate insights and create innovative solutions that deliver real value to organizations.

- ❤️ I love engineering, statistics, economy, AI/ML, among others subjects...
- 🔭 A nice proverb: The frog at the bottom of the pond knows nothing about the vastness of the ocean.
